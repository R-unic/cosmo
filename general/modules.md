  Modules are used to separate Cosmo code into separate files and import them

# ðŸ§± Modules

Cosmo's module system is similar to TypeScript. Here is an example of how you might import a file in the same directory:\


```sql
use member from "./mod_name"
```

You can import any intrinsics or Stars packages by just omitting the `./` and writing the name of the package/intrinsic.
